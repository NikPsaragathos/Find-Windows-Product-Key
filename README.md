# Find-Windows-Product-Key

Generally, if you bought a physical copy of Windows, the product key should be on a label or card inside the box that Windows came in. 
If Windows came preinstalled on your PC, the product key should appear on a sticker on your device. 
If you've lost or can't find the product key, simply use this script and find the Serial Number of your Windows.

Save if you like the serial number to a file (serial.txt) for future use.


Enjoy.
